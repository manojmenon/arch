# Security Observations

This directory contains security findings, observations, and remediation recommendations for the Project Management System.

## Purpose

The security observations directory serves as a centralized location for:
- Security audit findings
- Vulnerability assessments
- Security recommendations
- Incident response documentation
- Security policy violations
- Compliance observations

## File Naming Convention

Security observation files should follow this naming pattern:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-NN-description.md
```

Where:
- `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date of the observation
- `NN` is a sequential number for multiple observations on the same day
- `description` is a brief description of the security issue

## File Structure

Each security observation file should include:

1. **Header Information**
   - Date and time of observation
   - Observer/auditor name
   - Severity level (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info)
   - Category (Authentication, Authorization, Data Protection, etc.)

2. **Description**
   - Detailed description of the security issue
   - Affected components or systems
   - Potential impact

3. **Evidence**
   - Screenshots, logs, or code snippets
   - Trace IDs for correlating with application logs

4. **Risk Assessment**
   - Likelihood of exploitation
   - Potential business impact
   - CVSS score if applicable

5. **Remediation**
   - Specific steps to fix the issue
   - Timeline for implementation
   - Testing recommendations

6. **References**
   - Related security standards (OWASP, NIST, etc.)
   - External resources or documentation

## Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Immediate threat to system security, requires immediate action
- **High**: Significant security risk, should be addressed within 24-48 hours
- **Medium**: Moderate security risk, should be addressed within 1-2 weeks
- **Low**: Minor security concern, can be addressed in next maintenance cycle
- **Info**: Informational observation, no immediate action required

## Categories

- **Authentication**: Issues related to user authentication
- **Authorization**: Issues related to access control and permissions
- **Data Protection**: Issues related to data encryption, storage, and transmission
- **Input Validation**: Issues related to input sanitization and validation
- **Session Management**: Issues related to session handling and token management
- **Infrastructure**: Issues related to server, network, and deployment security
- **Compliance**: Issues related to regulatory compliance and standards

## Review Process

1. Security observations should be reviewed by the security team
2. Critical and High severity issues should be escalated immediately
3. Remediation progress should be tracked and documented
4. Regular security reviews should be conducted to identify new issues

## Integration with CI/CD

Security observations can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:
- Automated security scans can generate observation files
- Security tests can create observations for failed checks
- Deployment security checks can document findings

## Examples

See the following example files:
- `2024-01-15-01-jwt-secret-hardcoded.md` - Example of a high-severity finding
- `2024-01-15-02-sql-injection-risk.md` - Example of a medium-severity finding
- `2024-01-15-03-token-expiration-audit.md` - Example of a low-severity finding
